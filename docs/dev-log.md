*Living document tracking our technical decisions and current progress*

## üìÖ Current Session - June 6, 2025

### üé® **JITTER REDUCTION: Calmer Pond Creatures**
**Date**: Current session
**Issue**: Fish were exploring more but had become too jittery/nervous

**Fish Wandering Improvements**:
- **Less Frequent Direction Changes**: 30-90 frames instead of 20-60 for calmer movement
- **Reduced Direction Change Magnitude**: 3.0x instead of 4.0x for gentler turns
- **Minimal Continuous Jitter**: Back to 0.02 from 0.1 for smooth curves
- **Better Persistence Balance**: 60-80% instead of 50-70% for smoother flow
- **Gentle Momentum**: Reduced from 0.1 to 0.05 for less nervousness
- **Higher Speed Limit**: Increased to 1.8x for more exploration distance

**Frog Seeking Improvements**:
- **Much Calmer Hopping**: Reduced jitter from 0.3 to 0.1 for graceful movement
- **Smoother Target Approach**: Less frantic, more deliberate hopping

**Result**: 
- Fish now explore the entire pond with calm, flowing movements
- Frogs hop gracefully toward clicked targets without nervous energy
- Maintains exploration while achieving zen-like serenity

**Balance Achieved**: Exploration + Calmness = Perfect Magic Pond! üåô

**Next**: Test the balanced, serene ecosystem!

### üé® **WANDERING FIX: True Fish Exploration**
**Date**: Current session
**Issue**: Fish were "nervous hovering" instead of actually wandering around the pond

**Changes Made**:
- **Much More Frequent Direction Changes**: 20-60 frames instead of 40-120 
- **Bigger Direction Changes**: 4.0x jitteriness factor instead of 2.5x for dramatic turns
- **Much Less Direction Persistence**: 50-70% instead of 75%+ to break free from starting areas  
- **More Continuous Adjustments**: 0.1 instead of 0.05 for active movement
- **Added Momentum**: 0.1 gentle push to keep them moving even during direction changes
- **Higher Speed Limit**: 1.5x speed limit to allow faster exploration

**Technical Explanation**:
- **Old Behavior**: High persistence meant fish kept mostly their original direction
- **New Behavior**: Low persistence + frequent big changes = true exploration
- **Momentum Addition**: Prevents fish from getting "stuck" during direction transitions

**Result**: Fish should now swim throughout the entire pond area instead of staying near starting positions.

**Next**: Test the enhanced fish wandering behavior!

### üé® **BEHAVIOR TUNING: Magic Pond Improvements**
**Date**: Current session
**Issues**: Fish too clustered, fireflies too far/fast, need to understand swarm behavior

**Swarm Behavior Explanation**:
- **Each `<swarm>` = One Unified Behavior**: All creatures in a swarm share the same behavior
- **Individual Personalities**: Within the behavior, each creature has unique personality traits
- **Example**: All frogs use `seek-targets`, but each has different jitteriness/speed
- **DOM Structure**: `<swarm behavior="seek-targets">` ‚Üí all creatures seek clicked locations

**Fish Wandering Improvements**:
- **More Direction Changes**: 40-120 frames instead of 60-180 for more exploration
- **Bigger Turns**: 2.5x jitteriness factor instead of 1.5x for wider paths  
- **Less Persistence**: 75% minimum instead of 85% to allow more wandering
- **More Continuous Adjustment**: 0.05 instead of 0.02 for better spread

**Firefly Orbit Improvements**:
- **Slower Speed**: Reduced from 1.8 to 1.2 in HTML
- **Closer Orbits**: 60% orbital speed instead of 100% 
- **Stronger Inward Pull**: Distance-based pull (0.008 when far, 0.003 when close)
- **Gentler Wobble**: Reduced jitter from 0.2 to 0.1 for smoother magic

**Result**: 
- Fish now spread out more and explore the pond area
- Fireflies stay closer and orbit more gently around mouse
- Frogs still hop toward clicked targets (shared seek-targets behavior)

**Next**: Test the improved Magic Pond ecosystem!

### üé£ **BEHAVIOR TUNING: Zen Fish & Calm Frogs**
**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: Fish exhibiting nervous, jittery behavior instead of confident exploration; frogs too frantic when seeking targets

**Fish Calming Changes**:
- **Jitter Reduction**: Continuous angle adjustments reduced from 0.02 ‚Üí 0.01 for smoother gliding
- **Exploration Confidence**: Direction change frequency reduced (30-90 frames ‚Üí 60-180 frames) for longer, bolder swimming paths
- **Movement Persistence**: Increased from 60-80% ‚Üí 75-90% for more committed directional movement
- **Momentum**: Reduced from 0.05 ‚Üí 0.02 to eliminate micro-jitters while maintaining gentle propulsion

**Frog Calming Changes**:  
- **Seek Jitter**: Reduced from 0.1 ‚Üí 0.05 for more deliberate, less frantic hopping toward targets
- **Movement Style**: Changed from "frantic hopping" to "calm, deliberate hops" in code comments

**Expected Result**: Fish now swim in confident, flowing arcs across the pond instead of nervous hovering. Frogs make purposeful hops toward targets rather than anxious twitching.

**Next**: Test the zen pond experience!

### üì∏ **SNAPSHOT SYSTEM: DOM-Everything Approach**
**Date**: Current session
**Implementation**: Pure DOM-based snapshot system following the original seed architecture

**Core Design**:
- **Snapshots are `<snapshot>` DOM elements** - no separate modules or complex systems
- **Recursive state preservation** - snapshots contain complete game state as nested HTML
- **Navigation via DOM traversal** - restore by copying `snapshot.innerHTML` to `game-world.innerHTML`
- **Organic gallery creation** - buttons auto-generated from existing snapshots in DOM

**Features Implemented**:
- **üì∏ Save Moment Button**: Creates `<snapshot>` elements with magical random names
- **üåü Snapshot Gallery**: Auto-populates with buttons for each existing snapshot
- **üîÑ One-Click Restore**: Click any snapshot button to instantly restore that state
- **‚ôªÔ∏è Recursive Architecture**: New snapshots contain all previous snapshots (infinite nesting)

**Magic Pond as First Snapshot**:
- Pre-embedded "Magic Pond" snapshot in HTML as the foundation moment
- Gallery shows "üåü Magic Pond" button on page load
- Users can return to zen state anytime, then build from there

**Code Files**:
- `game-controls.js` - Added `createSnapshot()`, `restoreSnapshot()`, `initializeSnapshotGallery()`
- `index.html` - Added snapshot gallery UI and recursive `<snapshot>` element

**Next**: Test the snapshot system and add more magical moments!

### üé® **MOVEMENT TUNING: Smoother Wandering**
**Date**: Current session  
**Issue**: Wandering creatures had too much jitter relative to forward movement

**Adjustments Made**:
- **Reduced Continuous Jitter**: From 0.1 to 0.02 for gentler curves
- **Longer Direction Persistence**: Doubled timer intervals (60-180 frames instead of 30-90)
- **Stronger Momentum**: Minimum 85% direction persistence for smoother paths
- **Conditional Micro-Jitter**: Only very jittery personalities (>0.8) get micro-movements
- **Smaller Direction Changes**: Reduced major direction changes from 2x to 1.5x jitteriness
- **Standard Speed Limit**: Removed 1.2x speed multiplier for more predictable movement

**Result**: Wandering creatures now move in smooth, flowing paths with gentle curves instead of nervous jittering.

**Next**: Test the improved wandering behavior.

---

### üé® **MOVEMENT ENHANCEMENT: Natural Creature Behavior**
**Date**: Current session
**Reason**: Creatures felt "robotic" with too-predictable movement patterns

**Improvements Added**:
- **Personality Traits**: Each creature gets random personality on creation:
  - `jitteriness` (0.5-1.0) - How much they wiggle and dart around
  - `speedVariation` (0.8-1.2) - Individual speed differences
  - `directionPersistence` (0.7-1.0) - How much they stick to current direction
  - `wanderAngle` & `wanderTimer` - For more natural wandering paths

**Enhanced Wandering Behavior**:
- **Direction Persistence**: Creatures tend to continue in current direction rather than random each frame
- **Periodic Direction Changes**: Big direction changes every 30-90 frames instead of constant tiny adjustments  
- **Micro-Jitter**: Small continuous movement variations based on personality
- **Variable Speeds**: Each creature moves at slightly different speeds

**Personality Applied to All Behaviors**:
- **Chase**: Jittery creatures move more erratically when chasing
- **Flee**: More panic jitter when fleeing from mouse
- **Orbit**: Orbital wobble based on jitteriness level
- **Seek-Targets**: Excitement jitter when seeking clicked targets

**Benefits**:
- **Lifelike Movement**: Creatures feel more organic and less mechanical
- **Individual Character**: Each creature has its own movement style
- **Visual Interest**: More varied and unpredictable paths
- **Emergent Behavior**: Personality combinations create unique interactions

**Technical Implementation**:
- Personality traits stored on creature objects during `updateCreature()`
- Enhanced `wanderBehavior()` with angle-based movement and timing
- All behaviors now incorporate personality-based variations
- Backward compatible with existing creature data

**Next Step**: Test the enhanced movement patterns and observe creature behavior.

### üé® **UI IMPROVEMENT: Side-by-Side Layout**
**Date**: Current session
**Reason**: Controls were below the fold, making interactions less intuitive

**Changes**:
- **Split Layout**: Controls panel (350px) on left, canvas panel on right
- **No Scrolling**: Everything visible in viewport with overflow-y: auto on controls only
- **Better UX**: Immediate visual feedback when clicking buttons
- **Responsive**: Canvas and debug panel centered in right panel
- **Compact**: Tighter spacing and smaller fonts for more controls in view

**Benefits**:
- **Immediate Feedback**: See creatures react to button clicks instantly
- **Better Workflow**: Mouse interactions and button controls side-by-side
- **Professional Layout**: More app-like, less webpage-like
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new controls without affecting canvas view

**Next Step**: Test the improved layout and mouse interactions.

### üèóÔ∏è **MAJOR REFACTOR: Modular Architecture V3**
**Date**: Current session
**Reason**: Breaking up the monolithic game engine into separate modules for better organization and review

**New Modular Structure**:
1. **`modules/dom-sync.js`** - Pure DOM persistence layer
2. **`modules/simulation.js`** - Pure game logic with enhanced behaviors  
3. **`modules/renderer.js`** - Canvas rendering with mouse tracking visuals
4. **`modules/dom-tools.js`** - DOM manipulation utilities
5. **`modules/game-controls.js`** - Button event handlers
6. **`game-engine-v3.js`** - Main orchestrator that imports all modules

**New Features Added**:
- **Mouse Tracking**: Creatures can see and react to mouse position
- **Mouse Targets**: Click canvas to place targets that fade over time
- **New Behaviors**: chase, flee, orbit, seek-targets
- **Enhanced Controls**: 20+ buttons organized into logical sections
- **Visual Feedback**: Mouse cursor indicator and target rings on canvas

**Mouse Interactions**:
- **Chase**: Dogs follow mouse around
- **Flee**: Rabbits run away when mouse gets close  
- **Orbit**: Stars circle around mouse position
- **Seek Targets**: Fires move toward clicked locations

**Benefits**:
- **Easier Review**: Each module is focused and self-contained
- **Better Testing**: Pure functions with clear inputs/outputs
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new behaviors or rendering effects
- **Organized**: Button controls separated from core engine logic

**Files**: 
- All modules in `/modules/` directory
- `game-engine-v3.js` - New main engine
- Updated `index.html` to use ES6 modules

**Next Step**: Test the new modular system and mouse interactions.

### üßπ **CLEANUP: Removed Unused Element Definitions**
**Date**: Current session  
**Action**: Removed the entire `<element-definitions>` section from `index.html`

**Rationale**:
- Section was not being used by the current separated concerns architecture
- Game engine operates directly on live DOM elements in `<game-world>`
- Definitions were redundant with runtime game state
- Simplifies HTML structure and reduces confusion

**Result**: Clean HTML with only essential `<game-world>` section for live state.

**Next Step**: Ready to integrate real Anthropic API calls through BFF endpoint.

---

### üéØ Current State
- **Phase**: Minimal Bootstrap Implementation
- **Goal**: Get AI talking to DOM before building custom elements
- **Files Created**: `index.html` (initial structure)
- **Next**: Build canvas renderer that interprets DOM ‚Üí visual simulation

### üîß Technical Decisions Made

#### **Architecture Stack**
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5 + Canvas (no frameworks)
- **Backend**: Single BFF (Backend for Frontend) 
- **AI**: Anthropic API via BFF proxy
- **State**: DOM-everything approach (all state lives in DOM)
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas for immediate visual feedback

#### **Implementation Strategy**
**Phase 1 Order** (current):
1. ‚úÖ Bootstrap minimal HTML structure 
2. üîÑ Canvas renderer that interprets DOM ‚Üí visual simulation
3. ‚è≥ BFF proxy for Anthropic API calls
4. ‚è≥ AI modifies DOM ‚Üí canvas updates automatically  
5. ‚è≥ Custom elements layer (later)

**Rationale**: Get the AI ‚Üî DOM interaction working first, then add abstraction layers.

#### **DOM Structure Decisions**
```html
<element-definitions locked="true">
  <!-- Static primitive definitions (AI's vocabulary) -->
</element-definitions>

<game-world>
  <!-- Live game state that AI modifies -->
  <!-- Initial hardcoded swarm for testing -->
</game-world>
```

#### **Canvas Approach**
- **Why Canvas over DOM manipulation**: Immediate visual feedback, better performance for many moving objects
- **DOM as source of truth**: Canvas reads DOM state and renders it
- **Game loop**: RAF loop that reads DOM ‚Üí updates positions ‚Üí renders canvas

#### **Initial Hardcoded Simulation**
- Start with `<swarm emoji="üê±" count="5" behavior="wander">`
- Each creature has DOM element with `x, y, vx, vy` attributes
- Canvas renderer interprets this and draws moving cats

### üéÆ Current HTML Structure

```html
<!-- Element Definitions: AI's Vocabulary -->
<element-definitions locked="true">
  <swarm-definition emoji="üê±" behavior="playful,chasing,clustering">
  <flock-definition emoji="ü¶ã" behavior="flutter,avoid-crowding,spiral">
  <!-- etc -->
</element-definitions>

<!-- Game World: Live State -->
<game-world>
  <swarm emoji="üê±" count="5" behavior="wander" speed="2">
    <creature x="100" y="100" vx="1" vy="0.5"></creature>
    <!-- more creatures with positions/velocities -->
  </swarm>
</game-world>
```

### üîÑ Current Data Flow (Target)
1. **DOM contains game state** (creature positions, behaviors)
2. **Canvas renderer reads DOM** every frame
3. **Physics/behavior updates** modify DOM attributes
4. **AI modifications** change DOM structure
5. **Canvas automatically reflects changes**

### üß† AI Integration Plan
- **BFF Endpoint**: `/api/interpret` 
- **Request**: `{ command: "voice input", domContext: document.outerHTML }`
- **Response**: `{ toolCalls: [{ name: "create_element", params: {...} }] }`
- **Tools**: `create_element`, `modify_element`, `remove_element`

### üìù Next Immediate Steps
1. **Create `game-engine.js`** - Canvas renderer + game loop
2. **Test hardcoded swarm** - 5 cats wandering on canvas  
3. **Create simple BFF** - Node.js proxy to Anthropic
4. **Test AI interaction** - "add more cats" ‚Üí DOM changes
5. **Iterate on behaviors** - make cats more interesting

### ü§î Open Questions
- **Behavior implementation**: How complex should initial cat "wander" be?
- **Canvas sizing**: Fixed 800x600 or responsive?
- **Physics boundaries**: Wrap around edges or bounce?
- **AI detection of "magical moments"**: Start simple or build in early?

### üí° Key Insights
- **Start visual first**: Get something moving on canvas before AI integration
- **DOM as database**: Perfect for MCP tools (structured, declarative)
- **Rich primitives**: `<swarm>` vs `<entity behavior="swarm">` - AI reasons better with specific tags
- **Emojis as graphics**: Instant visual variety, scalable, understandable

### üèóÔ∏è **MAJOR REFACTOR: Separated Concerns Architecture**
**Date**: Current session
**Reason**: Original game engine was mixing simulation logic with DOM persistence

**New Architecture**:
1. **`DOMSync`** - Pure persistence layer (reads/writes DOM state)
2. **`Simulation`** - Pure game logic (no DOM dependencies)  
3. **`Renderer`** - Pure canvas drawing (takes game state, renders it)
4. **`GameEngine`** - Orchestrates the three concerns

**Benefits**:
- **Testable**: Each class has single responsibility
- **Extensible**: Can swap out rendering or persistence layers
- **Debuggable**: Clear data flow through the system
- **AI-Ready**: Clean interfaces for AI to understand and modify

**Data Flow**:
```
DOM ‚Üí DOMSync.loadGameState() ‚Üí Simulation.update() ‚Üí DOMSync.saveGameState() ‚Üí DOM
                                       ‚Üì
                              Renderer.render() ‚Üí Canvas
```
